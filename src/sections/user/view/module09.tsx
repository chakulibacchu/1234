            Social anxiety creates a fundamental belief: that other people's emotional states
            are your responsibility. If someone is uncomfortable, you caused it. If there's
            tension, you must fix it. If someone is unhappy, you need to make it better —
            even at the cost of yourself. This belief doesn't come from generosity.
            It comes from{' '}
            <span className="font-semibold text-amber-300">fear of what happens if you don't</span>.
            Boundaries are the practice of separating their emotions from your responsibility.

        Every boundary has three components: what you need, how you'll communicate it, and what
        you'll do if it's not respected. You only need the first two to start. The third comes with practice.

        The guilt doesn't disappear immediately after you set a boundary. It lingers. That's normal.
        Your job isn't to feel no guilt — it's to act despite the guilt and observe that the feared
        outcome doesn't materialise. Each time it doesn't, the guilt signal weakens.

      <Tip>
        The Post-Event Decompression is the most skipped step — and the most important for people
        with anxiety. Without a formal decompression, the residual energy of the interaction becomes
        fuel for the overthinking loop. Give yourself the transition time.
